> **Efficient Task and Domain Adaptation in ALS Semantic Segmentation via LoRA for PointNet++**  
Semantic segmentation of airborne LiDAR point clouds enables a broad range of urban and environmental applications. However, domain shifts between training and operational data, as well as the frequent emergence of new semantic classes, pose significant challenges for deploying deep learning models effectively. In this work, we explore the integration of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, into the PointNet++ architecture to address these challenges. We evaluate LoRA in two realistic scenarios: domain adaptation and incremental learning with novel classes, using large-scale LiDAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that LoRA achieves superior performance compared to traditional full fine-tuning, showing greater resistance to catastrophic forgetting and improved generalization, particularly for underrepresented classes. Furthermore, LoRA maintains or exceeds baseline accuracy with substantially fewer trainable parameters, highlighting its suitability for resource-constrained deployment scenarios. We also present TerLiDAR, a publicly available annotated airborne LiDAR dataset, to support further research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.

We present TerLiDAR, a fully open and annotated airborne LiDAR dataset that covers 51.4~km\textsuperscript{2} of urban and forested areas along the Ter River in Catalonia, Spain. The data were acquired in July 2021 using an ALS system mounted on a georeferenced aircraft operated by ICGC. The dataset comprises 692 million colorized 3D points, each annotated with one of the semantic classes listed in the paper.
